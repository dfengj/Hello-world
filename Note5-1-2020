  After first files in git, I am learning in portnov computer school, so again, I updated my personal information and password in order to access gitHub. I forgot those previous information.
  Today is May 1, 2020. We are under coronavirus, have been sheltting in home near two months. I have been looking for a suitable job after I came US. 
  Set note here to remind me those.
  Again today is Jun 24, 2020. The last class from Portnov, olga gave us this git class, let me try!
